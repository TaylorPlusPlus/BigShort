				and 1 share of the stock in debt. If you sell the stock right away,
				you would have $100 and owe 1 share of the stock. If the stock goes to $70,
				you can buy 1 share at that price and return it, leaving you with $30 in
				profit (not including any interest payments). This option is only recommended
